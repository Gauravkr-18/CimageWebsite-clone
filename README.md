# CIMAGE CLONE

This project is my third upload, where I practiced by cloning and slightly enhancing the Cimage website. (An educational institution or organization). The repository contains various images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG) and two main files:

- `INDEX.HTML`: The main HTML file for the website.
- `STYLE.CSS`: The stylesheet for the website's appearance.

## Features
- Static HTML and CSS website
- Includes a variety of images (logos, event photos, social icons)

## How to Use
1. Open `INDEX.HTML` in your web browser to view the website.
2. All images and styles are loaded locally from the project directory.
